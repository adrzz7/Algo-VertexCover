# Vertex Cover Approximation Algorithm

An academic project that implements a greedy approximation algorithm for solving the **Vertex Cover problem** in graph theory. The objective is to find a set of vertices such that each edge in the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set.

## 🧩 Problem Overview
The Vertex Cover problem is NP-hard, and this project demonstrates a 2-approximation greedy solution that selects edges and adds both endpoints to the vertex cover iteratively.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python
- NetworkX (for graph handling)
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

## 📌 Key Features
- Constructs custom or predefined graphs
- Implements a greedy approximation algorithm for vertex cover
- Visualizes the graph and highlights selected vertex cover nodes
- Compares result with the optimal vertex cover (where applicable)

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated
- Algorithm implementation
- Graph theory
- Problem solving and optimization
- Visualization using NetworkX
